                    I am an Assistant Professor at #[a(href="http://www.cs.sdsu.edu/") Department of Computer Science], #[a(href="https://www.sdsu.edu/") San Diego State University]. 
                p.
                    My research interest lies in the intersection of computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive sciences. 
                    I use machine learning and other computational methods to study the short-term adaptation and long-term change in language. 
                //- I use computational methods to examine how people interact (linguistically and behaviorally) at multiple representation levels, from lower levels such as lexical and syntactic elements, to higher levels such as information content etc.
                //- By taking into account the interactions that occur across the broad spectrum of these representation levels, I look forward to obtain a unified perspective of dialogue that better captures the nature of human interaction. 
                //- I am particularly interested in the interactive and collaborative nature of human dialogue. 
                //- For details about my current research work, see my #[a(href="pubs/research_statement_xu.pdf") research statement].
                //- p.
                //-     My current research projects include: historical change of languages in the world, modeling dialogical interaction with distributed representations, the balance between predictability and uncertainty in language, and so on.
