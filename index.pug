                p.
                    We are a group of active researchers in the areas of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, cognitive sciences, and psycholinguistics. We explore the scientific principles behind human being's capability of comprehending and producing complex languages.  
                p We are particularly interested in a broad range of research questions:
                ul
                    li Communication effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues.
                    li Multi-modality nature of dialogue: mixture of vocal, gesture, and facial information. 
                    li Inter-speaker #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_entrainment") alignment/entrainment] that occurs in dialogue.
                    li Information density in natural language.
                    li Long-term langauge change/evolution.
                p.
                    Please go to the #[a(href="projects.html") projects] page for detailed introduction to ongoing and past projects.
                //- I use computational methods to examine how people interact (linguistically and behaviorally) at multiple representation levels, from lower levels such as lexical and syntactic elements, to higher levels such as information content etc.
                //- By taking into account the interactions that occur across the broad spectrum of these representation levels, I look forward to obtain a unified perspective of dialogue that better captures the nature of human interaction. 
                //- I am particularly interested in the interactive and collaborative nature of human dialogue. 
                //- For details about my current research work, see my #[a(href="pubs/research_statement_xu.pdf") research statement].
                //- p.
                //-     My current research projects include: historical change of languages in the world, modeling dialogical interaction with distributed representations, the balance between predictability and uncertainty in language, and so on.
